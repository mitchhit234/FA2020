\subsubsection*{Problem 1}

a.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]

\item
The most appropriate distribution that can be used to model STAT 3113 scores from Section A is a normal distribution, according to its AIC score

\item
The mean parameter, $\mu$ is estimated to be 89.666304 \\
The standard deviation parameter, $\sigma$, is estimated to be 2.7653256 \\
The variance parameter, $\sigma^2$ is estimated to be 7.647025674 \\

\item
The most appropriate distribution that can be used to model STAT 3113 scores from Section B is a weibull distribution, according to its AIC score

\item
The mean parameter, $\mu$ is estimated to be 79.9657 \\
The standard deviation parameter, $\sigma$, is estimated to be 1.53 \\
The variance parameter, $\sigma^2$ is estimated to be 2.34129 \\
The scale parameter, $\alpha$, is estimated to be 80.650259 \\
The shape parameter, $\beta$, is estimated to be 66.269092 

\item
The probability that a randomly picked student from Section A scores more than 86 marks is $1 - 0.092451 = 0.907549$, or 90.75 percent (v pic)

\item
The probability that a randomly picked student from Section B scores less than 86 marks is $1$, or 100 percent (vi pic)

\item
The lowest score you can achieve and still be in the top 5 percent of Section A would be a score of 94.22 percent (vii pic)

\item
The lowest score you can achieve and still be in the top 5 percent of Section B would be a score of 82.20 percent (viii pic)

\end{enumerate}

b.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]

\item
The most appropriate distribution that can be used to model failure times of the bearings is a weibull distribution, according to its AIC score

\item
The mean parameter, $\mu$ is estimated to be 4459.2 \\
The standard deviation parameter, $\sigma$, is estimated to be 2293.35 \\
The variance parameter, $\sigma^2$ is estimated to be 5259442 \\
The scale parameter, $\alpha$, is estimated to be 5033.1405 \\
The shape parameter, $\beta$, is estimated to be 2.0364645

\item
90 percent of the bearings would have failed at the time value equal to 7580.608 hours (1biii pic)

\item
The probability that a randomly selected bearing last more than 8000 hours is is $1 - 0.923422 = 0.076578$, or 7.7 percent (biv pic)


\end{enumerate}
