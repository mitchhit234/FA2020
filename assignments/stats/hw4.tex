\item
\bd{Response Variable:} Battery Life, measured in hours

\item
\bd{Factor 1:} Material Type \\
\bd{Factor Levels:} Material 1, Material 2, Material 3 \\

\bd{Factor 2:} Temperature \\
\bd{Factor Levels:} 15$^{\circ}$F, 75$^{\circ}$F, 125$^{\circ}$F

\item
\bd{Number of Replications:} 4 replications per treatment combination, 36 replications total

\item
Check the assumption that population distributions are normal:

Shape of the distrubution resembles the shape of a normal distribution in the histogram, therefore making it safe to assume that the populations follow a normal distribution \\

Check the assumption that the population distributions have the same variance:

Residual plot values average out to around 0 and the residual plot shows no increasing or decreasing relations, therefore making it safe to assume that the populations have the same variance

\item
$H_0:$ Overall model is not significant \\
$H_1:$ Overall model is significant

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

Our final p value for the model is evaluated at $< 0.0001$ \\
With our $\alpha$ value assumed to be 0.05, the p-value $< \alpha$, meaning we reject $H_0$ and can conclude our overall model is significant
\vspace{1em}

\item

As with our overall model, our p value for the interaction with tempature and material type is less than our significane level $\alpha$, meaning we can conclude that interaction is significant. Since an interaction with both of our main effects is significant, there is no reason to further test the main effects individually
