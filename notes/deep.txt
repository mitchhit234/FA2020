Lec 1 Intro:

What is deep learning?

Deep learning is a class of Neural Network Algorithims

Neural networks are a branch of Machine learning

Machine learning is a branch of Artifical Intelligene


Deep Learning <- Neural Networks <- Machine Learning <- Arifitcal Intelligence



Artifical Intelligence - How to make computers do things at which, so far, humans are better (EX: Cars that drive themselves, Computers that play Chess)



Dijkstra asks the questions: Can machines think?
Student say no...
Then he asks: Can submarines swim?
Students mostly say no
Then he asks: Can planes fly?
Everyone says yes

Dijkstra's perspective is that thinking is computation, and in essence, computers can think



New definition for A.I. - the field that studies the synthesis and analysis of computational agents that act intelligently

Agent - an entity that acts in an environment

Computational - behavior can be described in terms of computation

Acting Intelligenly - Does the agent:
Do what is appropriate for its circumstances and goals?
Is flexible in changing to its environments and changing goals?
Learns from experience?
Makes the appropriate choices given its perceptual and computational liminations?



A.I. is not a field about how to imitate humans, instead it is a broad collection of different techniques and algorithims each intended to a particular purpose




Machine Learning is the branch of A.I. that studies learning mechanisims for Intelligent Agents

Learning:
- The range of behaviors is expanded; the agent can do more
- The accuracy on tasks is improved; the agent can be better
- The speed on tasks is improved; the agent can be faster




Neural Networks:
A computational learning mechanisim inspirde by the function of biological neurons (Not exactly a simulation)

Neural Networks are usually used for supervised learning. Neural Networks are used to recognize patterns from training data

But as the size of the data grows, the time needed for learning grows at an exponential rate (The curse of dimensionality)

Deep learning is what is used to counter the effects of the curse of dimensionality




Deep Learning:
A class of Neural Network Architectures and Algorithms to address problems arising from large input data and large networks









Lec 2 A.I. and Agents:


Goals of AI:
Scientific Goal - to understand the principles that make intelligent behavior possible in natural or artifical systems
Engineering Goal - design of useful, intelligent artifacts


Inputs to an agent:
Abilities - the set of actions an agent can perform
Goals/Preferences - what the agent wants, its values
Prior Knowledge - knowledge that the agent starts off knowing
History - Current stimuli (input from the environment) and past stimuli


Example Agent: Autonomus car

Abilities - steer, accelerate, brake
Goals - get to the destination quickly and safely
Prior knowledge - street maps, road sign meanings, recognize various road blocks
Stimuli - cameras for vision, GPS, microphones
Past experiences - success/failures from previous trips




Aspects of Intelligent Agents:

Representation - How does the agent internally represent relevant information? With the Knowledge Base (abilities, preferences, prior experiences)

How does the agent characterizes its goal?
Optimal - the best solution according to given criteria
Satisficing - a good enough solution by some criteria
Approximate - mesaure of quality is good enough
Probable - something like a good solution

When does the computational work of the agent take place?
Design - done by designer
Offline - done by agent before acting, provides part of knowledge base
Online - done by agent between reciving stumli and acting
