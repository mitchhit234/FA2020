1.1 Age of Exploration

European nations seeked expansion for glory, gold, and silver, while Asian countries sought out other resources such as silks and spices

Columbus gained permission from Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain to seek a way to Asia through westward sailing

The Treaty of Tordesillas from 1494 drew a north to south line through South America, giving Spain the territory to the west and Portugal the territory to the east, including the east coast of Brazil

Spanish Conquistadors brought over Eurpoean diseases that decimated native populations

Europe introduced cattle, horses, pigs, wheat, rye, and smallpox to the americas, while the americas gave Europe maize, potatoes, tobacco, beans, squash, peppers, cacao, and syphillis

In 1513, Vasco Nunez de Balboa became the first European to see the pacific ocean from Panama

Juan Ponce de Leon found Flordia and claimed it for Spain
Hernando de Sato traversed to Oklahoma and the Mississippi river in 1541
Francisco Vazquez de Coronado crossed the Rio Grande through New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, and Kansas
None of these exploers found the riches they were seeking, but they used their journies as oppurtunities to map out the americas and claim land for Spain



1.2 Beggining of Colonization

Converting natives to the Catholic fate was important to Spain at the beggining of their colonization quest

As the indian population declined, the Spanish begain to import slaves from Africa and take over the native's land

Spain used an army of conquistadores (mostly independent Spanish adventurers) to conquer the americas

In time, Portugal, France, England, and the Netherlands all started to challenge Spain with their colonization of the americas

Richard Hakluyt's writings urged the colonization of the americas, justifying it as the oppurtunity to spread the gospel

Jamestown, Virginia was the first established English colony in 1607
The Virgina company of London and the Virgina company of Plymouth gained permission from King James the I to settle in Jamestown. They handled English trading with the Middle East, Russia, and Africa

France renewed its interest shortly after England, starting in the aeras Jacques Cartier visited
The St. Lawerence river was the first French gateway into the interior of America
In 1606, Samuel de Champlain established a trading post in Quebec which later became new France

The Netherlands sent an english man in 1609, Henry Hudson, to discover a potentaion North West passage. He discovered the Hudson River

The Dutch created a relationship with the natives for trade, using Manhattan and Albany as their traiding grounds


Puritans placed great importance on family. Young people were generally subject to their parent's direction, and they believed in education, specifically reading, so they could read the bible
As a result, New England was ahead of other colonies educationally and enjoyed widespread literacy

In the 1650s, the British became more involved in regelating trade. Mercantilists belive that wealth was sharply limitied, meaning that in a trade, one nations gain was always the other nation's loss

The navigation acts of 1651, 1660, 1663, and 1673 were used by England to protect them from their rivals, but ultimatley, they set up some of the most important pieces of imperial legislation during the colonial period

In the mid 1600's, Purtians feared New England was drifitng away from its religious purpose and more focused on making money than a relationship with God. They dealth with this issue by proposing a Half Way Covenant,l a sort of half way church membership to the children of members of the church, in order for the church to start spreading its teachings early


As New England's population grew, tensions between the Puritians and natives grew. In 1675 an Indian cheif named King Phillip led a war to exterminate the whites. 2000 settlers were killed before the chief was killed

In 1692, several young girls in Salem Massachutes claimed to be tormented by some of their neighbors (witchcraft). Puritan minisiters, such as Cromwell Martyr, were exectued along with some villagers as suspects of witchcraft. 


1.3 The Colonial World

By the 1700s, England was a great trading empire in the colonial world. They were the most populus group of settlers in North America. Comcerical confilict between the Dutch and English led to war in the 1660s, but besides that, English stayed unconstested #1

America's population continued to grow rapidly, due to the success of the colonies and large scale immagration from the irish, scottish, and germans as well



1.4 The 18th Century

The Enlightenment:
Stemmed from England, the focus on rationalism and the belief that guman reason was enough to solve all of mankind's problems, and faith was not as important as once thought

The Great Awakening
Series of religious revivals happening in the colonies from the 1720s to 1740s. Seperation between old belifes and new belifes. Some Ivy league schools were founded during these times, to foster new ministers to influence and spread religious belife

The French and Indian War
Stemmed from tension between England and France over the territory of the ohio valley and pennslyvania. Also called the Seven Years War. The treaty of Paris ended the war in 1763, Britian gained Canada and France lost most of its North American territories. Great Britian imposed revenue taxes on the colonies to pay for the war, and also kept the colonials from expanding into their new land due to it being reserved for the natives



2.1 The Coming of the American Revolution

The British drive to gain more authority over the colonies began in 1763

American colonies had come to believe that the creation of a republic would solve the problems of a monarchal rule

George Greenville, an anti-american, became prime minister, and due to the ending of the seven years war, sent the royal navy to supress american smuggling and enforce more harsh navigation acts (that had been not enforced well up to this point)
Also enforced the parliament sugar act (revenue act), which raised revenue tax on american imports

Greenville maintained up to 10,000 british soilders in america to control the colonies and natives, as weall as have the americans pay for that expense

In 1765, Greenville passed the stamp act, imposing a direct tax on americans for the very first time
Stamp act required americans to purchase revenue stamps on everything from newspapers to legal documents
Americans reacted by claiming taxation without representation is tyranny
There was a revolt in Massachsettes from the sons of liberty, led by James Otis and Samuel Adams
Other colonies soon followed, renouncing the stamp act, and in October came together as a congress to proclaim their issues with the act
Boycotting of british goods followed

Prime Minister Greenville was replaced with Charles Lord Rockingham, and he repealed the stamp act
It was replaced by the Declaratory Act, which made it ok for Britian to tax and make laws for americans in all scenarios

Rockingham was replaced with Charles Townshed, who imposed the townshed acts, which taxed items imported to the colonies.
In 1768, Massachusetts legislature, under the leadership of samuel adams, passed the Massachsetts circualr letter calling parliment to repeal the townshead acts
Britian responded with threatening the massachusetts legislation of their legitamecy, and sent troops to Boston. This only arroused american restitance

The next prime minister, Fredrick Lord North, repealed all of the taxes except for the tax on tea, which was still a huge product. This led to tensions rissing at the Boston Massacre

In May of 1775, the second continental congress met in philly, and called for george washington to lead the continental army against Britian
King George the 3rd declared the collonies in rebellion and made preperations for war with america
The prohobition act stated the official declaration of war against america

On June 7th, 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced a series of policies to congress calling for independence and a new national government
Congree accepted, John Dickinson worked out the framework for the national government, and Thomas Jeffersion worked on drafting the decleration of independence
The decleration was adopted by congress on July 4th, 1776, and america officially declared independence

American army was badly outtrained, outnumbered, and outequiped
France helped america by giving most americans their weapons. Britian and France has pre-established tension, which made them want to help america and weaken britian's power
America's victory in Saratoga in 1777 was the first major turning point of the war



2.2 The War for Independence

Negotiations were not only influenced by america and britian, but as well as France and Spain

The treaty of Paris of 1783 was composed of six different parts
1. The united states was recognized as an independent nation by the major european powers, including britian
2. Its western boundary was set by the Mississippi river
3. Its southern boundary was set at 31 degree north latitude (northern boundry of flordia)
4. Britian retained canada but had to surrender flordia to spain
5. Private british creditors would be free to collect any debts owed by US citizens
6. Congress was to recommend that states restore confiscated loyalists property



2.3 The Creation of New Governments

After the collapse of british authority in 1775, it became neccesary to form new state governments. By 1777, 10 new state's constitutions had been formed, becoming the first efforts to establish a government by the american people (the beggining of democracy on american soil)

The first framework for a national government was the Articles of Confederation, drafted in 1776. It contained many points of disagreement, so it soon began being edited. In addition, america was in a deep financial crisis after the war, so  they amended the articles to impose taxes on the american people. 

After the war, many loyalists (about 100,000) did not stay after the war and moved back to Canada, the west indies, or britain. 

The war had shaken up class and social relationships. All white men gained the right to vote, as property requirements were removed. Northern states began to free slaves. Women had had different roles during the war, but after became mostly confined into the domestic sphere. Natives lost even more land and more rights, regardless of what side they had fought with




3.1 Development and Ratification

Meetings in 1785 and 1786 were made to discuss economic and social issues in the new nation, but few representatives showed up from the states

The previous Articles of Confederation were seen as a weak document, and there was a lot that needed to be discussed and rewritten

In 1787, all the representatives finally meet in philly, including james madison, alexander hamiltion, robert morris, john dickision, and benjamin franklin, at the constitutional convention
George washingtion was elected to preside the convention

The constitution was prefaced wuth many checks and balances to prevent one group from gaining too much power
James Madison, known as the father of the constitution, devised a plan for the new national government
The Virgina Plan called for an executive branch and two houses of congress, with a strong national government that could overturn state laws. William Paterson called for unicameral legislatures which equal representation for states, which was described by the new jersey plan (a bicameral legislature was used in the end, outlined in the connecicut compromise by roger sherman)

The constitution purposefully was not endorsed or condemed by the constitution, and each slave was to count as 3/5th of a person when it came to representation and taxation

It was also decided, to limit the power of the president, for a president to serve for a term of 4 years and could be re-elected without a term limit. They would be elected by a electoral college as a check to democracy, in which the states would have the same number of electors as it did senators and representatives combined. House would break ties

The ratification of the constitution took a long time. Federalists, who favored central power, promoted the constitution, while anti-federalists who more supported states right were against it.
The federalists papers by alexander hamiltion, james madison, and john jay, demonstrated how the constituion was designed to prevent the abuse of power by any level of government. It was finally ratified in 1790, and george washington became president in march 1789



3.2 Outline of the United States Constitution

The constituion is a living documents, which means it can be amended
The bill of rights, introduced by james madision, has been included in the constitution since 1791 and secured the final states needed to accept the constitution

The constitution focuses on the seperation and limitation of powers

The bill of rights consisted of the first ten amendments to the constitution and outlined many of the personal rights state constitutions already guaranteed:
1. Right to freedom of religion and speech, and to assemble and petition the government
2. Right to keep and bear arms to maintain a well-regulated militia
3. Right to not house soilders during time of war
4. Right to refuse an unreasonable search and seizure
5. Right to not testify against oneself in a court of law
6. Right to a speedy trial by an impartial jury
7. Right to a jury in civial cases
8. Right to not face cruel and unusual punishment or excessive fines
9. Rights retained by the people that are not specifically enumerated in the constitution
10. States' rights to powers not specifically delegated to the federal government
