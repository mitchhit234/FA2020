1.1 Age of Exploration

European nations seeked expansion for glory, gold, and silver, while Asian countries sought out other resources such as silks and spices

Columbus gained permission from Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain to seek a way to Asia through westward sailing

The Treaty of Tordesillas from 1494 drew a north to south line through South America, giving Spain the territory to the west and Portugal the territory to the east, including the east coast of Brazil

Spanish Conquistadors brought over Eurpoean diseases that decimated native populations

Europe introduced cattle, horses, pigs, wheat, rye, and smallpox to the americas, while the americas gave Europe maize, potatoes, tobacco, beans, squash, peppers, cacao, and syphillis

In 1513, Vasco Nunez de Balboa became the first European to see the pacific ocean from Panama

Juan Ponce de Leon found Flordia and claimed it for Spain
Hernando de Sato traversed to Oklahoma and the Mississippi river in 1541
Francisco Vazquez de Coronado crossed the Rio Grande through New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, and Kansas
None of these exploers found the riches they were seeking, but they used their journies as oppurtunities to map out the americas and claim land for Spain



1.2 Beggining of Colonization

Converting natives to the Catholic fate was important to Spain at the beggining of their colonization quest

As the indian population declined, the Spanish begain to import slaves from Africa and take over the native's land

Spain used an army of conquistadores (mostly independent Spanish adventurers) to conquer the americas

In time, Portugal, France, England, and the Netherlands all started to challenge Spain with their colonization of the americas

Richard Hakluyt's writings urged the colonization of the americas, justifying it as the oppurtunity to spread the gospel

Jamestown, Virginia was the first established English colony in 1607
The Virgina company of London and the Virgina company of Plymouth gained permission from King James the I to settle in Jamestown. They handled English trading with the Middle East, Russia, and Africa

France renewed its interest shortly after England, starting in the aeras Jacques Cartier visited
The St. Lawerence river was the first French gateway into the interior of America
In 1606, Samuel de Champlain established a trading post in Quebec which later became new France

The Netherlands sent an english man in 1609, Henry Hudson, to discover a potentaion North West passage. He discovered the Hudson River

The Dutch created a relationship with the natives for trade, using Manhattan and Albany as their traiding grounds


Puritans placed great importance on family. Young people were generally subject to their parent's direction, and they believed in education, specifically reading, so they could read the bible
As a result, New England was ahead of other colonies educationally and enjoyed widespread literacy

In the 1650s, the British became more involved in regelating trade. Mercantilists belive that wealth was sharply limitied, meaning that in a trade, one nations gain was always the other nation's loss

The navigation acts of 1651, 1660, 1663, and 1673 were used by England to protect them from their rivals, but ultimatley, they set up some of the most important pieces of imperial legislation during the colonial period

In the mid 1600's, Purtians feared New England was drifitng away from its religious purpose and more focused on making money than a relationship with God. They dealth with this issue by proposing a Half Way Covenant,l a sort of half way church membership to the children of members of the church, in order for the church to start spreading its teachings early


As New England's population grew, tensions between the Puritians and natives grew. In 1675 an Indian cheif named King Phillip led a war to exterminate the whites. 2000 settlers were killed before the chief was killed

In 1692, several young girls in Salem Massachutes claimed to be tormented by some of their neighbors (witchcraft). Puritan minisiters, such as Cromwell Martyr, were exectued along with some villagers as suspects of witchcraft. 


1.3 The Colonial World

By the 1700s, England was a great trading empire in the colonial world. They were the most populus group of settlers in North America. Comcerical confilict between the Dutch and English led to war in the 1660s, but besides that, English stayed unconstested #1

America's population continued to grow rapidly, due to the success of the colonies and large scale immagration from the irish, scottish, and germans as well



1.4 The 18th Century

The Enlightenment:
Stemmed from England, the focus on rationalism and the belief that guman reason was enough to solve all of mankind's problems, and faith was not as important as once thought

The Great Awakening
Series of religious revivals happening in the colonies from the 1720s to 1740s. Seperation between old belifes and new belifes. Some Ivy league schools were founded during these times, to foster new ministers to influence and spread religious belife

The French and Indian War
Stemmed from tension between England and France over the territory of the ohio valley and pennslyvania. Also called the Seven Years War. The treaty of Paris ended the war in 1763, Britian gained Canada and France lost most of its North American territories. Great Britian imposed revenue taxes on the colonies to pay for the war, and also kept the colonials from expanding into their new land due to it being reserved for the natives



2.1 The Coming of the American Revolution

The British drive to gain more authority over the colonies began in 1763

American colonies had come to believe that the creation of a republic would solve the problems of a monarchal rule

George Greenville, an anti-american, became prime minister, and due to the ending of the seven years war, sent the royal navy to supress american smuggling and enforce more harsh navigation acts (that had been not enforced well up to this point)
Also enforced the parliament sugar act (revenue act), which raised revenue tax on american imports

Greenville maintained up to 10,000 british soilders in america to control the colonies and natives, as weall as have the americans pay for that expense

In 1765, Greenville passed the stamp act, imposing a direct tax on americans for the very first time
Stamp act required americans to purchase revenue stamps on everything from newspapers to legal documents
Americans reacted by claiming taxation without representation is tyranny
There was a revolt in Massachsettes from the sons of liberty, led by James Otis and Samuel Adams
Other colonies soon followed, renouncing the stamp act, and in October came together as a congress to proclaim their issues with the act
Boycotting of british goods followed

Prime Minister Greenville was replaced with Charles Lord Rockingham, and he repealed the stamp act
It was replaced by the Declaratory Act, which made it ok for Britian to tax and make laws for americans in all scenarios

Rockingham was replaced with Charles Townshed, who imposed the townshed acts, which taxed items imported to the colonies.
In 1768, Massachusetts legislature, under the leadership of samuel adams, passed the Massachsetts circualr letter calling parliment to repeal the townshead acts
Britian responded with threatening the massachusetts legislation of their legitamecy, and sent troops to Boston. This only arroused american restitance

The next prime minister, Fredrick Lord North, repealed all of the taxes except for the tax on tea, which was still a huge product. This led to tensions rissing at the Boston Massacre

In May of 1775, the second continental congress met in philly, and called for george washington to lead the continental army against Britian
King George the 3rd declared the collonies in rebellion and made preperations for war with america
The prohobition act stated the official declaration of war against america

On June 7th, 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced a series of policies to congress calling for independence and a new national government
Congree accepted, John Dickinson worked out the framework for the national government, and Thomas Jeffersion worked on drafting the decleration of independence
The decleration was adopted by congress on July 4th, 1776, and america officially declared independence

American army was badly outtrained, outnumbered, and outequiped
France helped america by giving most americans their weapons. Britian and France has pre-established tension, which made them want to help america and weaken britian's power
America's victory in Saratoga in 1777 was the first major turning point of the war



2.2 The War for Independence

Negotiations were not only influenced by america and britian, but as well as France and Spain

The treaty of Paris of 1783 was composed of six different parts
1. The united states was recognized as an independent nation by the major european powers, including britian
2. Its western boundary was set by the Mississippi river
3. Its southern boundary was set at 31 degree north latitude (northern boundry of flordia)
4. Britian retained canada but had to surrender flordia to spain
5. Private british creditors would be free to collect any debts owed by US citizens
6. Congress was to recommend that states restore confiscated loyalists property



2.3 The Creation of New Governments

After the collapse of british authority in 1775, it became neccesary to form new state governments. By 1777, 10 new state's constitutions had been formed, becoming the first efforts to establish a government by the american people (the beggining of democracy on american soil)

The first framework for a national government was the Articles of Confederation, drafted in 1776. It contained many points of disagreement, so it soon began being edited. In addition, america was in a deep financial crisis after the war, so  they amended the articles to impose taxes on the american people. 

After the war, many loyalists (about 100,000) did not stay after the war and moved back to Canada, the west indies, or britain. 

The war had shaken up class and social relationships. All white men gained the right to vote, as property requirements were removed. Northern states began to free slaves. Women had had different roles during the war, but after became mostly confined into the domestic sphere. Natives lost even more land and more rights, regardless of what side they had fought with




3.1 Development and Ratification

Meetings in 1785 and 1786 were made to discuss economic and social issues in the new nation, but few representatives showed up from the states

The previous Articles of Confederation were seen as a weak document, and there was a lot that needed to be discussed and rewritten

In 1787, all the representatives finally meet in philly, including james madison, alexander hamiltion, robert morris, john dickision, and benjamin franklin, at the constitutional convention
George washingtion was elected to preside the convention

The constitution was prefaced wuth many checks and balances to prevent one group from gaining too much power
James Madison, known as the father of the constitution, devised a plan for the new national government
The Virgina Plan called for an executive branch and two houses of congress, with a strong national government that could overturn state laws. William Paterson called for unicameral legislatures which equal representation for states, which was described by the new jersey plan (a bicameral legislature was used in the end, outlined in the connecicut compromise by roger sherman)

The constitution purposefully was not endorsed or condemed by the constitution, and each slave was to count as 3/5th of a person when it came to representation and taxation

It was also decided, to limit the power of the president, for a president to serve for a term of 4 years and could be re-elected without a term limit. They would be elected by a electoral college as a check to democracy, in which the states would have the same number of electors as it did senators and representatives combined. House would break ties

The ratification of the constitution took a long time. Federalists, who favored central power, promoted the constitution, while anti-federalists who more supported states right were against it.
The federalists papers by alexander hamiltion, james madison, and john jay, demonstrated how the constituion was designed to prevent the abuse of power by any level of government. It was finally ratified in 1790, and george washington became president in march 1789



3.2 Outline of the United States Constitution

The constituion is a living documents, which means it can be amended
The bill of rights, introduced by james madision, has been included in the constitution since 1791 and secured the final states needed to accept the constitution

The constitution focuses on the seperation and limitation of powers

The bill of rights consisted of the first ten amendments to the constitution and outlined many of the personal rights state constitutions already guaranteed:
1. Right to freedom of religion and speech, and to assemble and petition the government
2. Right to keep and bear arms to maintain a well-regulated militia
3. Right to not house soilders during time of war
4. Right to refuse an unreasonable search and seizure
5. Right to not testify against oneself in a court of law
6. Right to a speedy trial by an impartial jury
7. Right to a jury in civial cases
8. Right to not face cruel and unusual punishment or excessive fines
9. Rights retained by the people that are not specifically enumerated in the constitution
10. States' rights to powers not specifically delegated to the federal government




4.1 The Federalist America

Americans did not want monarchs, nobels, commoners, family based polotics, or anything like the previously established social hierarchy
United states wantted to add more value on protecting individual interests

Federalists drafted and supported the constitution to have a strong centeralized government

Emphasized nationhood, meaning laws were carried out all throughout the nation

The constitution ended up being ratified in 1788


4.2 Washingtion's Administration

Georgre Washingtion formed his administration, including alexander hamiltion as the head of the department of treasurey, and edmund randolph as the department of justice (first attorney general)

Washington decided he was going to appoint individuals to different departments in the executive branch, and set the precedence for this idea

Appointed founding fathers such as thomas jefferson, alexander hamiltion, henry know, and edmund randolph
 
Hamiltion created the foundation of america capitilism by creating a budget funded by a national debt. He created a federal tax system, amd a national bank. Farmers opposed this, seeing these polocies as enriching the elite at the expense of commoners

Political parties began to appear during washingtion's administration, including the federalists and republicans

Republicans did not agree with federalist polocies. Federalists had support from business owners and finiancial systems, while republicans had their support from rural and frontier areas of the south and west



4.3 Foreign and Internal Affairs

Between 1792 and 1795, there were a couple of internal and external problems america was facing

During the france revolution, and france declaring war with europe, washingtion declared neutrality. But because there was still trade happening between the french and u.s., british began attacking us traders and forcing them to enlist with the british navy

John Jay negotiated a treaty in 1794, setting a foundation for diplomacy, with britian to stop capturing U.S. trading ships

The Pinckney Treaty of 1796 between the spain and U.S. allowed the u.s. to be included with spanish traffic in the mississippi river, opening up their port in louisiana

In 1794, general anthony wayne defeated the indians at the battle of fallen timbers, and created the resulting treaty of greenville, which cleared the ohio territory of indian tribes

Also in 1794, the whiskey rebellion emerged, where western farmers refused to pay tax on whiskey (which was essential to hamiltions revenue program), chaos started. Washington sent out military to deal with the rebellion. That put an end to the rebellion. Policies began to become stronger and stronger under washington



4.4 John Adam's Administration

Served as George Washington's vice president, first president to reside in the white house in 1801

Inherited an undeclared naval war with french, they had already floundered 300 naval ships trading with britian
Adams immediatley acted to restore a relationship with france, and bribes were involved
These diplomatic agreements involving bribes became known as the XYZ affairs



4.5  The Jeffersonian Era

Thomas Jefferson did not share the ideas of the federalists. He wanted a nation of independent farmers living under a central government that did not hold a lot of power, but existed to serve and protect individual liberties
He appointed men to his cabinet who agreed with his philosihp, including james madison as secretary of state and albert gallatin to lead the department of treasurey

John Marshall was the first judge of the judicial branch to exhbit power outside of what the constitution had given the judicial branch
He asserted the power of judicial review over federal reistration, which has become the foundation of the supremem courts check on the other two branches

Jefferson was the first president to really excersice and push the power he possessed. He impeached many federalist judges in the judicial branch and challenged others in his own branch, while also courating congressional members and leading as the head of his party

Jefferson completed the purchase of the louisiana purchase from France and napolean in 1803. There was questions about his power to do so, and how this would give too much power to his party the republicans, but in the end jefferson made the purchase

Meriwether Lewis and William Clark explored the new regions and beyond, all the way to the pacific ocean. THe U.S. now had complete control of the mississippi river for trade

Jefferson repealed the whiskey tax program and government expenditures



4.6 Madison's Administration

James Madison, a republican, was elected in 1808
Federalists still had the majority in the house and the senate

Madison faced more international crisis in his presidency
The renewal of the European war created conflict with britian and france, and neither wanted the other trading with america. They created trading blockades
Jefferson Embargo act of 1807 had prohibited foreign trade, however, madison changed this, declaring war over the issue of neutral shipping rights. This lead to the war of 1812



4.7 Internal Developments

Following 1812 were years of rapid economic and social development, which lead to a severe depression by 1819. Afterwords, the country was moving much more towards an industrialized state and eyeing westward expansion, which resulted in what was known as the era of good feelings

Demand for american cotton, grain, and tobacco helped spur their economic growth. Commerce flourished during this time

Doctorines of the enlightenmnet became very popular and diesm gained a considerable following. Rationalism, unitarianism, and universialisim also shot up in popularity during this time. This led to a second great awakening

Personal salvation and an emotional response to God's grace was emphasized

Women and blacks were also players in this awakening, which started to create unrest among slave communities in the south



4.8 The Expanding Economy and Industrilization

At this point in history, U.S. population was doubling every 25 years
By 1840, over 1/3 of americans live in western territories
Immigration from abroad started increasing rapidly since 1820

Markets for farm products grew in expanding cities with the liberal and sale polocies, more and more land was put into culivation

The cotton kingdom was at the height of its power, made up of alabama, mississippi, louisiana, and texas

The growing market for food and animals in the cotton south allowed new western famrers to specilaize in those items, and further stimulated the western movement

Fishing became important in new england and chesepeake area, deep sea whaling became a significant enterprise in ports from rhode island to massachussettes

The Santa Fe trail, from missouri to new mexico, became an active trading grounds opening up the spanish territories to american migration

The transportation revolution involved a sequence of innovation and inventions (also called the true revolution, since it evolved communication as well) Steamboats were built for river traffic, cannals were built, trains were starting to emerge

Canals were the first development project to recieve major funding from the government and public funds.

Samuel Slater built the first successful cotton spinning mill in the united states. The first cotton manufacturing plant was built in boston in 1813

The large growth of industrialization, business, and the things that accompinyed that resulted in extra workers being needed. Women were hired and were payed small wages for hard work

Bad working conditions resulted in the growth of unions during this time period

There was a rise in the public school system during this time period, before schools were primarily sponsored by private institutions

This is the time where people around the world started to notice that there was many oppurtunites for people to make a name for themselves, and were allowed to start a new life where they had greater oppurtunites than normal to achieve great things



5.1 The Jacksonian Democracy

Most white men, regardless of property ownership, were now able to vote
Party leaders starting choosing their partie's canidates and platforms
Elite were still in charge of many different polotics

Jackson lowered government spending, and vetoed bills that were using federal funds to fund internal improvements
Jackson prevented a bill that would restart the national bank

Jackson signaled the involving of the common man in political life


5.2 The Jacksonian Indian Policy

Jackson heavily supported the removal of indian tribes beyond west of the mississippi river
The indian removal act of 1830 provived the federal backing for that to happen, relocating all indians east of the mississippi river out west
The route that the indians (cheorkees) used to leave eastern united states was know as the trail of tears, which decimated their population

This set the precedence of the bad relationship between the US and natives, and natives have never recovered their own land since



5.3 The Election of 1840

Jackson's arrogant behavior, how some saw he was abusing the veto power, gave him the bad reputation of 'king andrew'

A group called the Whigs opposed him, and formed the countrie's second party system

The panic of 1837 during Martin Van Buren's administration ensured the Whig's victory in the election of 1840

The Whigs nominated William Henry Harrison, and the election had the largest voter turn out to this date. THe campaign was a dramatic one, where both parties visciously campaigned for their leader and against the other

Harrison died one month into office, making the new president John Tyler



5.4 Age of Reform

1840 was an era of transisiton and instability (reformation). Many new ideas were being discussed and tested on different levels. Reform, order, and control were all emphasized

Writer Walt Whitman gave a sense of individulisam to the people
Edgar Allen Poe, author of the Raven and Anabel Lee, explored the world of spirit and emotion

Fine arts also started to emerge in american society

Utopian communities, such as the mormans, started to emerge

European romanticism became the source of inspiration for many americans back then

Schools began training for many different professionals, and ideas for schools started being tested

Mental hosiptials and prisions were also created

Feminisim started to rise, as well as abolitionist movements

Democrays and Whigs fought so hard in new york city that state military had to be called in, race riots were frequent, and mob movements over religion occured



5.5 The Role of Minorities

Some slaves attempted to run away, but few openly rebelled due to the harsh consuquences 

Many slaves survivied/made the best of their situation by relying on family ties and religious faith

Free blacks in the south were called mulattos, and some even owned slaves (purchasing their own family members)

The planter class were large farmers who owned 50+ slaves, and even though they were a minority in the south, they excersiced most of the political and economic power

During westward expansion, slave traders shipped slaves by the thousands to the new open cotton lands of the gulf states, inside the new territories was purchased

The importation of slaves from abroad was outlawed by congress in 1808, but southerners continued to smuggle slaves in until the 1850s, which continued internal trade of slaves

Women had fewer oppurtunites in the south, most tied to family activities, operation of the farms, and nurses to the slaves

Husbands often slept with women slaves, opening the country to mixed children. High birth and death rates were rampant in the south



5.6 The Westward Expansion

Soil exhaustion and falling prices were common in long established farmland, and people wanted to take advantage of the new cheap territory to the west

Although the west was populated by lations, mulattos, and indians, the west was potrayed as empty land to the americans, cheap and fertile

Settlers moved along the overland trail, and underwent great physical hardship



6.1 The Crisis of 1850 and America Mid-Century

The california gold rush began in 1848, and the free soil party emerged in the united states

The free soil party consisted of rebellious northern democrats, anti-slavery whigs, and the liberty party (which had emerged in 1840)

Nominated Martin Van Buren for president, did not want slavery in the new territories of mexico

By 1854, 300,000 people had gone to california for resources, the greatest mass migration in american history, shifted the nation's center westward, spurred construction of railroads and telegraph line

The compromise of 1850 gave california statehood as a free state, and banned slavery in washington dc. The fugitive act was passed

President pierce wanted to distract the US from the issue of slavery, and issued an agressive program of foreign, economic, and terrirotial expansion, know as 'young america'

The main factor of economic transformation in the 1840s and 1850s was railroads. Created a nationwide market, linked the midwest to the north east (not the south)

Water transportation also increased, introducing steamboats, inland rivers, and clipper ships

Whigs were seen as a weak party since they were split over the issue of slavery

The nativist movement, lead by the 'know nothing party', combated foreign influences and wanted to uphold and promote traditional american ways



6.2 The Return of Sectional Conflict

Fugitive slave law was not liked in the north, it basically made kidnapping legal and kept africian americans from being truly free in the north

Harriet Beecher Stowe, who was enraged with the fugitive slave law, wrote uncle tom's cabin, a fictional book depiciting the perspective of a slave, showing the evils of slavery
The book was denounced and banned in the south, while being a bestseller n the north

Senator Stephen A Douglas introduced a bill to organize the territories west of missouri, current day kansas and nebraska, and make a continential railroad. He also tried to touch the issue of slavery, but was pressed by southern senators to allow popular soverignty, which ended up overturning the previous ruling of the missouri compromise

The kansas nebraska act destroyed the whig party, and led to the creation of the republican party

With the democrats split within the north and south, the republican victory in the election of 1860 with abraham lincoln was assured. Before he was even elected southern states were succeding, starting with north carolina

In the Dred Scott v Sanford case, dred scott was suing for his own freedom, on the basis that he had been living in a free syaye for several years
President Buchanan encourgaed the justicies to attempt and settle the slavery issue once and for all, and in march 1857, the supreme court made its decison that africian americans were not entitled to freedom, and could never be citizens of the united states, and the missouri compromise was unconstitutional

Northerns were convinved there was a 'salve power' problem in the national government where pro-slavery comspirators were pulling the strings in favor of the south

There was a short economic depression in america in 1857 called the panic of 1857, caused by faulty bank systems, overspeculation in railroads and land, and european captial being interrupted due to their increased interest in the south

In 1858, stephen a douglas (the oponent of lincon in the 1860 election) held a democratic seminar with lincoln, where he made his stance that he did not see slavery as a moral wrong, but as an economic benifit

Went after lincon for being a radical abolitionist that beileved in racial equality and racial mixing



6.3 The Coming of the Civil War

In October 1859, john brown led a raid on the federal arsenal in virgina. He took hostages and wanted to incite a slavery uprising. His actions were extreme, so he only had support from some abolitionists
He was charged with treason and executed. His death was mourned, and southern slave owners were concerned by his actions

Slave owners were concerned the southern whites who did not own slaves (the majority of the southern population) would come to see that slavery was not in their best interest

Hinton Rowan Helper wrote the impending crisis in the south, which was used by the republican party as a campaign literature

When lincoln was campiagning, he declared he had no intention of disturbing slavery where it already existed, but southerners did not believe him, and feared people like john brown

South Carolina was the first state to seceed from the union in december 1860. In the next two months, alabama, georgia, flordia, mississippi, louisiana, and texas joined south carolina, becoming the cofederate states of america

They elected Jefferson Davis, former secreatary of war, as their first president, and alexander stephens as vice president

The main disconnect was that the north was willing to accept compromise up to the fact that slavery would not spread outside of where it already existed, while the south were not open to any compromsing 



7.1 Hostilities Begin

Confederate general P.G.T Beauregard, acting on the orders from the president of the confederate states, opened fire on fort sumter on april 12th, 1861

Lincoln declared insurrection, and called on states to provide volunteers to put down the movement. IN response, virginia, tennesee, north carolina, and arkansas declared their sucession

Not all slave states secedded, delaware, kentucky, maryland, and missouri ended up staying

North had 5 major advantages over the south:
Much more wealthy, able to finance the war
Superior in industry and materials needed for war
Three to one ratio of population between the north or south, and south was 1/3rd slaves
North retained control of US navy
North had a superior system of railroads

South had an advantage in generals, and the fact that they were mostly fighting defensively

Confederates had robert e lee, joseph e johnson, and albert c.b. johnston, while northen had winfield scott, ulysses s grant, and william t sherman



7.2 The Union Preserved

Lincoln and his successor andrew johnson wanted a lenient and quick plan for reconstruction

By mid 1862, lincoln was under pressure within his own party, and hoping to create a favorable impression of foreign entities as well as domestic, he wrote up the emancipation proclimation, giving the union an official reason for the war beyond reuniting the country


7.3 The Ordeal of Reconstruction

After lincoln was assasinated, his successor from the souch, andrew johnson, wanted to make sure there was a reconstruction

Confederate states had to ratify the 14th and 15th amendments, and congress passed the militay reconstruction act, which attempted to protect voting and civil rights for blacks

Freed slaves suffered from economic problems, they did not have the resources to succeed in the aftermath of the war

Next president ulysees s grant faces many issues. Economic issues were prevelant and his cabinet was involved in many scandals

Most southern states had completed the requirements for reconstruction by 1876

Rutherford B. Hayes was the first democratic president to beback in office, and he withdrew troops from louisiana and south carolina, in many ways putting an end to the republican administration in the south. Rights for blacks regressed after this point
