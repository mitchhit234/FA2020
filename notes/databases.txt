Data are known facts that can be recorded, and has implicit meaning

Annual size of the global datasphere is growing exponentially

Structed vs unstructed data
Structuring unstructured data could be very benifical


Database is a collection of related data

DBMS is a system that enables users to create and maintain a database (think SSMS)

Database System is the combination of the database, DBMS, and application


A DBMS does many tasks:

Controls Redundancy
Restricting Unauthorized access
Providing Persistent Storage
Efficent Querying Process
Backup and Recovery
Multipule User Interfaces
Representation of Complex Relationships
Integrity Constraints
Interference Actions



Architecture
Lots of systems have the application and DBMS on seperate servers
Some also have an application server between the application and database servers
With an application server, you can store logic that is requested by different types of applications (web browser, iphone app, etc.) Reduces effort of future modifications needed, isolates application to changes on the database
