Data are known facts that can be recorded, and has implicit meaning

Annual size of the global datasphere is growing exponentially

Structed vs unstructed data
Structuring unstructured data could be very benifical


Database is a collection of related data

DBMS is a system that enables users to create and maintain a database (think SSMS)

Database System is the combination of the database, DBMS, and application


A DBMS does many tasks:

Controls Redundancy
Restricting Unauthorized access
Providing Persistent Storage
Efficent Querying Process
Backup and Recovery
Multipule User Interfaces
Representation of Complex Relationships
Integrity Constraints
Interference Actions



Architecture
Lots of systems have the application and DBMS on seperate servers
Some also have an application server between the application and database servers
With an application server, you can store logic that is requested by different types of applications (web browser, iphone app, etc.) Reduces effort of future modifications needed, isolates application to changes on the database

The domain is the set of atomic values for an attribute A    dom(A)

Examples:
dom(EmplyeeID) = dddddddd  (d stands for digit)
dom(Status) = (Active, Retired, Deceased, Inactive)


Row/tuple:

t = (v1, v2, v3, ... v_n) where each v_i has 1 <= i <= n is NULL or an element of  dom(A_i)


Relation Schema:

R(A1, A2, A3 ... A_n) where a is an attribute name

Ex: AVENGERS(LNAME, FNAME, STATUS, ... ETC)


Relation State:

r(R)

r = (t1, t2, t3, ... t_n) where t is a tuple defined earlier




Characteristics of Relationships:

Ordering of the Tuples:

A relationship is a set of tuples, and sets have no order
Therefore, ordering of tuples make no difference
However, when retriving tuples, its usually good practice to order them in some way

Ordering of the Values in a Tuple

Ordering of values in a Tuple is essential because the spot of the value is how it is coordinated to its attribute
The order of the attributes is not important however, as long as they are matching up to their correct values in the tuple
However, when setting up attributes, usually putting the primary key as the first attribute is the best practice


Values and NULLs in a Tuple

Values in tuples are atomic. NULL is the absence of a value, therefore two tuples who have NULL for the same attribute do not have the same value for that attribute
