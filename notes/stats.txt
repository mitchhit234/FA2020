Natural variability is the realization that no two individuals are exactly identical

Sampling variability is the realization that the results from any two given samples are not identical


IVPPSS:
Individual - one of the items examined by the researcher
Variable - the characterisitc of the item being examined
Population - all individuals of interest
Parameter - summary of all data collected from the individuals (mean, median, etc.)
Sample - the subsection of the population inspected in the actual experiment
Statistic - same as parameter, but only for the sample (EX: mean of 50 items)



Variable Types - Quantitative and Categorical


Quantitative Variables are either Continuous or Discrete:
Discrete is when the value is countable (EX: number of X ants) and continous is when the value is uncountable (EX: miles between X aï»¿nd Y). No potential values exist between 1 and 2 ants, but an infinite number of values exists between 1 and 2 miles.

Categorical variables are either Ordinal or Nominal
Ordinal variables are variables with a natural order (Freshman, Sophmore, etc.) while Nominal variables are variables with no order or ranking (Red, Blue, etc.)




A Retrospective Study uses data of a historical process archived over time

A observational study observes and measures variables of interest but do not interfere to a point where the outcome would be effected

A Designed experiment deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals in order to observe their subsequent responses.

Example of a designed project


Project Topic - The effect of ball type and shot distance on the ability of a shooter to make a shot

Objective - Assess the effect of the type of ball and shot distance on number of shots made

Motivation for Experiment - If this experiment shows that the type/distance significantly effect ability to make a shot, players can improve their skill practicing these harder shots

Response Variable - Number of shots made out of X

Factors - Type of ball and Shot Distance



Randomization - used some sort of random number generator to decide the way/the order you conduct your experiment

Replication - Each combination of factors will be performed mutlipule times to improve accuracy

Summary Statistics:

Measures of Central Tendency

Mean - arthimetic average of data in a sample
Population Mean - avergae value of all the observations in a population
Sample Median - middle value of data when arranged in order. If the number of data points is even, median is the average of the two middle values
Mode - most frequent value for data points (can be used for qualitative data as well)

Measures of Variation/Spread

Sample Variance - measured in square of original units. Summation of: a data point minus the mean, squared, divided by size of data points minus 1, for every data point

Standard Deviation - positive square root of sample variance

Sample range - maximum value minus minimum value

Quartile - when an ordered set of data is divided into four equal parts, the divided points are called quartiles

Interquartile range(IQR): Upper quartile minus lower quartile (upper quartile is at 75% highest, lower is 25% highest)

Variability:
Natural Variability is the fact that no two individuals are identical
Sampling Variability is the fact that results from any two samples are not identical

IVPPSS:
I - Individual - an item of interest in the study
V - Variable - characteristic recorded about individual
P - Population - all individuals of interst
P - Parameter - summary of variables in population
S - Sample - subset of the population being surveyed
S - Statistic - summary of variables in a sample

Types Of Data:
Quanitative - Continous and Discrete
Qualitative - Ordinal and Nominal

Sampling Methods:
Retrospective Study - uses sample of a historical process data archived over time
Observational Study - passivley observe individuals, measure variables of interst. no intent on influcing the outcome
Designed Experiment - activley impose some treatment on individuals in order to observe responses

Designed Experiments:
Factors - inputs to a process (control variables of an experiment)
Treatments - levels of the factors
Treatment Combinations - total number of possible combinations for factors and treatments
Response Variable - outcomes observed in the experiment 
Replication - a repeat run of a specific treatment combination, help measure experimental random error
Randimization - allocation of experimental material and order in which specifc runs are performed are randomly determined

Summary Statistics:
Sample Mean - numerical average of observations in a sample
Population Mean - numerical average of observations in a population
Sample Median - middle value when data is ordered, if observations is even, median is average of the two middle values
Sample Variance - variability of the data 
Sample Standard Deviation - square root of the sample variance
Sample Range - maximum value minus minimum value
Quartile - division points of the data set, lowest quartile Q1 is the value that has approx 25% of values below it, Q2 50%, Q3 75%
Interquartile Range (IQR) - Q3 minus Q1 (upper minus lower)

Sets:
Sample Space(s) - set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
Event - Subset of the sample space(s) of a random experiment
Compliment - a compliment of A would be the set of all outcomes that are not in A (A^c)
Mutually Exclusive - sets that have no outcomes in common (A intersection B = empty)

Probability:
Given any random experiment/event A, P(A) is the probabilty that A occurs, measured as the proportion of times that event A would occur in the long run, if the experiment were to be repeated over and over again
Axioms in written notes

Conditional Probability and Independence:
Unconditional Probability - probability based on the entire sample space
Conditional Probability - probability of one event occurring with some relationship to other events, based on a part of the sample space, may have certain restrictions
Independent Events - two events are independet if one has no influence on the other

Mutually Exclusive Events are events where the occurunce of one event automatically rules out the occurence of the other (EX: getting tails on a flip means you cant get heads)
Independent Events are the opposite of mutually exclusive 

Multiplication Rule:
See handwritten notes
A set of events are exhaustive if their union covers the entire sample space

The Law of total Probability
See handrwitten notes

Bayes Rule
Provides a formula that allows us to calculate one of the conditional probabilities if we know the other one

Random Variable:
A fuinction which assigns a numerical value to each outcome in a sample space. Typically denoted by capital letters. Discrete or Continuous
The distribution of a random variable consits of the set of all possible values of X (domain), and a function that describes how to assign probabilites to events involving X

Probability Mass Function (pmf):
See handwritten notes (and for cumulative distribution function cdfls)




Unit 2:

A random variable is continious if it can take on any value in an interval. The counterpart of a discrete variable, which can only be a subset of values (usually whole numbers)
Probabilites for continuous random variables are given by areas under a curve of their respective probability density functions (pdf), denoted f(x)
CDF = Cumulative Distribution Function of a random variable, describes the distribution of random variables



Exponential Distribution is used to represent the lifetime of certain types of equipment or represent the elapsed time before an event occurs
Exponentaiol distribution does not remember how long we have been waiting, and cannot feel that an event is due because we have waited s amount of time already. Waiting time is constantly "restarting" (Memoryless Property)



Weibull Distribution is often used to model the time until failure of many different physical systems
Parameters in this distribution allow engineers to account wear and tear and other factors



If a continuous random variable X with mean mu and variance theata squared has the following pdf (in paper notes), then we say X is normally distributed or X follows a normal distribution (or Gaussian distribution)
Most important and commonly used distribution used in statistics, it can model many continuous populations well

A normal distribution is always symmetric around its mean
Its graph has a bell shaped curve with one peak

Z = Standard normal random variable
Mean = 0, variance = 1



Statistical inference is divided into two major areas, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing

A statistical hypothesis is a claim or assertion about the value of a single or several population parameters
A null hypothesis is a claim about a population parameter that is assumed to be true until declared false (cannot be proven true, but can be assumed true)
Alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis we want to establish by the end of our testing. Strong evidence is needed to belieive it to be true

A statistical test will either reject H_0 or fail to reject H_0

Type 1 error: rejected H_0 when H_0 is true (false positive)
Type 2 error: fail to reject H_0 when H_0 is false (false negative)
Confidence level = 1 - alpha
Power = 1 - beta

P value is the probability of observing data as extreme or more extreme than that which was observed. It is also the smallest significance level at which the null hypothesis would be rejected for the given data
If p value is less than a, reject H_0, otherwise fail to reject H_0
