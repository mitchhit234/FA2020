Natural variability is the realization that no two individuals are exactly identical

Sampling variability is the realization that the results from any two given samples are not identical


IVPPSS:
Individual - one of the items examined by the researcher
Variable - the characterisitc of the item being examined
Population - all individuals of interest
Parameter - summary of all data collected from the individuals (mean, median, etc.)
Sample - the subsection of the population inspected in the actual experiment
Statistic - same as parameter, but only for the sample (EX: mean of 50 items)



Variable Types - Quantitative and Categorical


Quantitative Variables are either Continuous or Discrete:
Discrete is when the value is countable (EX: number of X ants) and continous is when the value is uncountable (EX: miles between X aï»¿nd Y). No potential values exist between 1 and 2 ants, but an infinite number of values exists between 1 and 2 miles.

Categorical variables are either Ordinal or Nominal
Ordinal variables are variables with a natural order (Freshman, Sophmore, etc.) while Nominal variables are variables with no order or ranking (Red, Blue, etc.)




A Retrospective Study uses data of a historical process archived over time

A observational study observes and measures variables of interest but do not interfere to a point where the outcome would be effected

A Designed experiment deliberately imposes some treatment on individuals in order to observe their subsequent responses.

Example of a designed project


Project Topic - The effect of ball type and shot distance on the ability of a shooter to make a shot

Objective - Assess the effect of the type of ball and shot distance on number of shots made

Motivation for Experiment - If this experiment shows that the type/distance significantly effect ability to make a shot, players can improve their skill practicing these harder shots

Response Variable - Number of shots made out of X

Factors - Type of ball and Shot Distance



Randomization - used some sort of random number generator to decide the way/the order you conduct your experiment

Replication - Each combination of factors will be performed mutlipule times to improve accuracy
