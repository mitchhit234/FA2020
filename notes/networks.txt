The internet is billions of connected computing devices of three types:
	
	Computing Devices:
	Hosts/end systems, they run network apps at internet's "edge"

	Routers:
	Packet switches: forward "packets" between hosts (chunks of data)
	Ex: routers, switches

	Links:
	Communication links (wired and wireless)
	Ex: fiber, copper, radio, satellite
	Transmission rate: bandwith


Networks are a collection of devices, routers, and links, managed by an organization

The internet is essentially a network of networks (Interconnected ISPs)





The internet is also an infrastructure that provides services to applications

Protocols control sending and reciving of messages
Ex: HTTP, ICP, IP, WiFi, 4G, Ethernet

Internet standards
RFC: Request for comments
IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force


Network core consists of interrconnected routers
Ex: local/regional or national/global ISPs (11)



The internet provides a programming interface to distributed applications

Hooks allow sending/reciving of apps to connect to and use internet transport service

Provides service options, similar to postal service



Back to the internet structure:

Connect end systems to edge routers with:
Residential access nets
Institutional acces networks (school, company)
Mobile access networks (WiFi, 4G, 5G)

Tranmission rate and shared/dedicated access among users effect performance





8-26

Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) are different channels transmitting different frequency bands


Acces via cable based: (14)
Hybrid fiber coax (HFC) has up to 1.2 Gbs down, up to 100 Mbps up

Acces via digital subscriber line: (13)
use existing telephone line to central office DSLAM
up to 50 Mbps down, 16 Mbps up



Wireless access networks is shared among multipule end systems and connects them to the router

Wireless local area networks (WLAN) are typically within or around building (100ft)

Wide area celluar access networks are provided by celluar networks, typically 10km radius, slower transmission rate than WLANs


Enterprise networks are operated by companies, universities, etc
Mix of wired, wireless linked technologies, connecting multipule different switches and routers





Host sending function:
takes application message,
breaks into smaller chuncks, known as packets, of length L bits,
transmits packet into access network at link transmission rate R

packet transmission delay = L/R (bits/bits per second)



Links: physical media

bit propagates between transmitter and reciever
the physical link is what lies between transmitter and reciever
guided media is when signals propogate in a solid media (copper, fiber, coax)
unguded media is when signals propogate freely (radio, WiFi)

types of solid media:
twisted pair - two insulated copper wires (Cat 5/6)
coaxial cable - two concentric copper conductors, bidirectional, brodband. multipule frequency channels on cable, 100's Mbps per channel
fiber optic cable - glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse being a bit. high speed operation (100's Gbps), low error rate (immune to electromagnetic noise)

types of unguided media:
wireless radio - signal carried in electromagnetic spectrum. can be obstructed by the environment
terrstrial microwave, wireless LAN, wide area celluar, satellite





Packet-switching is when the hosts break application-layer messahes into packets
Transmission delay takes L/R seconds to transmit an L-bit packet at R bps
Store and forward: entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted to the next link
End-end delay: 2L/R(above), assuming zero propagation delay

Packet queuing and loss: if arrival rate to link exceeds the transmission rate of link, packets will queue, waiting to be transmitted on output link OR packets can be dropped if memory buffer in router fills up

Forwarding: local action, move arriving packets from router's input link to appropriate router output link
Routing: global action, determine source to destination paths taken by packets



Circuit switching is an alternative to packet switching where end-end resources are allocated, and reserved for a call between the source and destination
Has dedicated resources, no sharing enables guaranteed performance
Circuit segment idle if not being used by that specific host
Not used that much today, but used in traditional telephone networks


Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is like the way described above

Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) has slots divided by time, each call allocated can transmit at maximum rate of wider freqeucny bands, but only during its time slots
