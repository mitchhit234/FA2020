The internet is billions of connected computing devices of three types:
	
	Computing Devices:
	Hosts/end systems, they run network apps at internet's "edge"

	Routers:
	Packet switches: forward "packets" between hosts (chunks of data)
	Ex: routers, switches

	Links:
	Communication links (wired and wireless)
	Ex: fiber, copper, radio, satellite
	Transmission rate: bandwith


Networks are a collection of devices, routers, and links, managed by an organization

The internet is essentially a network of networks (Interconnected ISPs)





The internet is also an infrastructure that provides services to applications

Protocols control sending and reciving of messages
Ex: HTTP, ICP, IP, WiFi, 4G, Ethernet

Internet standards
RFC: Request for comments
IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force


Network core consists of interrconnected routers
Ex: local/regional or national/global ISPs (11)



The internet provides a programming interface to distributed applications

Hooks allow sending/reciving of apps to connect to and use internet transport service

Provides service options, similar to postal service



Back to the internet structure:

Connect end systems to edge routers with:
Residential access nets
Institutional acces networks (school, company)
Mobile access networks (WiFi, 4G, 5G)

Tranmission rate and shared/dedicated access among users effect performance





8-26

Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) are different channels transmitting different frequency bands


Acces via cable based: (14)
Hybrid fiber coax (HFC) has up to 1.2 Gbs down, up to 100 Mbps up

Acces via digital subscriber line: (13)
use existing telephone line to central office DSLAM
up to 50 Mbps down, 16 Mbps up



Wireless access networks is shared among multipule end systems and connects them to the router

Wireless local area networks (WLAN) are typically within or around building (100ft)

Wide area celluar access networks are provided by celluar networks, typically 10km radius, slower transmission rate than WLANs


Enterprise networks are operated by companies, universities, etc
Mix of wired, wireless linked technologies, connecting multipule different switches and routers





Host sending function:
takes application message,
breaks into smaller chuncks, known as packets, of length L bits,
transmits packet into access network at link transmission rate R

packet transmission delay = L/R (bits/bits per second)



Links: physical media

bit propagates between transmitter and reciever
the physical link is what lies between transmitter and reciever
guided media is when signals propogate in a solid media (copper, fiber, coax)
unguded media is when signals propogate freely (radio, WiFi)

types of solid media:
twisted pair - two insulated copper wires (Cat 5/6)
coaxial cable - two concentric copper conductors, bidirectional, brodband. multipule frequency channels on cable, 100's Mbps per channel
fiber optic cable - glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse being a bit. high speed operation (100's Gbps), low error rate (immune to electromagnetic noise)

types of unguided media:
wireless radio - signal carried in electromagnetic spectrum. can be obstructed by the environment
terrstrial microwave, wireless LAN, wide area celluar, satellite





Packet-switching is when the hosts break application-layer messahes into packets
Transmission delay takes L/R seconds to transmit an L-bit packet at R bps
Store and forward: entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted to the next link
End-end delay: 2L/R(above), assuming zero propagation delay

Packet queuing and loss: if arrival rate to link exceeds the transmission rate of link, packets will queue, waiting to be transmitted on output link OR packets can be dropped if memory buffer in router fills up

Forwarding: local action, move arriving packets from router's input link to appropriate router output link
Routing: global action, determine source to destination paths taken by packets



Circuit switching is an alternative to packet switching where end-end resources are allocated, and reserved for a call between the source and destination
Has dedicated resources, no sharing enables guaranteed performance
Circuit segment idle if not being used by that specific host
Not used that much today, but used in traditional telephone networks


Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is like the way described above

Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) has slots divided by time, each call allocated can transmit at maximum rate of wider freqeucny bands, but only during its time slots

Packet switching vs Circuit switching

Packet switching allows more users to use the network
Ex: 1 Gb/s, each user has 100Mb/s when active, but only active 10% of the time

Circuit switching would allow up to 10 users
Packet switching could allow 35 users easily, the probability that there are more than 10 active users at a time is less than 0.4%

Packet switchintg is great for "bursty" data, but is also exposed to packet dealy and loss due to buffer overflow




Internet structure:

Hosts connect to internet via access ISPs
Access ISPs are connected to each other, so any two hosts can send packets to each other
Resulting network of networks is very complex, its evolution was driven by economics and national policies

How do ISPs connect to each other?

Connecting each asccess ISP to each other directly doesnt scale well [O(n^2)]

One option is connecting each access ISP to one global transit ISP. Customer and provider ISPs work with each other to accomplish that
There are more than one global ISP however; the market is competitive

Global ISPs connect via an IXP (internet exchange point) or peering link (direct connecting between 2 global ISPs)
Regional ISPs may also arise to connect cunsomer ISPs to Global ISPs

Then Content provider networks (Google, Microsoft) may run their own network 
to bring services and conent close to end users, bypassing tier 1 and even regional ISPs




Packet delay, the four soucres:

Nodal delay = d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop

nodal processing: check bit errors, determine output link, typically < ms

queueing delay: time waiting at output link for transmission, depends on cogestion level of router

transmission delay: packet length divided by transmission rate (bps) (L/R)

propagation delay: length of physical link divided by propagation speed (2x10^8 meters per second) (d/s)


Throughput: rate at which bits are being sent from sender to reciever

instantaneous: rate at a given point and time
average: rate over longer period of time

Networks are complex with many pieces
- hosts
- routers
- links of various media
- applications
- protocols
- hardware, software


Layers: each layer implements a service cia its own internal-layer actions. They rely on services provided by layers before
Explicit structure allows identification, relationship of complex system's pieces
Modularization eases maintenance, updating of system
Changes in layer's service implementation is transparent to the rest of the system


Internet Protocol Stack is each layer put together (51)

- Application Layer
Supporting network applications (IMAP, SMTP, HTTP)

- Transport Layer
Process-process data transfer (TCP, UDP)

- Network Layer
Routing of datagrams from source to destination (IP, Routing Protocols)

- Link Layer
Data transfer between neighboring network elements (Ethernet, 802,11, WiFi, PPP)

- Physical Layer
Bits "on the wire"





Internet was not originally designed with much security in mind. It was thought that it would contain a group of mutually trusting users attached to a transparent network
Internet protocl designers have been trying to patch this issue


Malware can get in to a host from:

A virus - self replicating infection by receiving and executing object (EX: email attachment)
A worm - self rplicating infection by passively receiving object that gets itself executed

Spyware malware can record keystrokes, web sites visited, and upload info to a collection site

Infected host can be enrolld in botnet, used for spam or distributed denial of service (DDos) attacks

Denial of Service attackers make resources unavaliable to legitimate traffic by overwhelming the resource with bogus traffic

Packet "sniffing" is reading/recording all packets passing by 

IP spoofing sends packets with a false source address
