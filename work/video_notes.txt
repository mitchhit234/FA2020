Video Notes:

Talking points:

- Backround about the internship and myself

- My intern responsibilities

- My experience/thoughts:

	- US Bank cares about their employees

	- They gave me the oppurtunity to do things outside my job role

	- Learn new skills whenever possible
	
	- Finding effective ways to communicate was extremley helpful

	- I stood out even though I didn't do the best work because of my work ethic and innovation

	- Optimizing virtual internships has a long way to go (onboarding, video calls)

	- Adapting to your work environment ASAP is important. Educate yourself on company protocol/terminology

	- Don't be afraid to ask questions (but always try your own solution first)

	- 








































































What are the goals of this video?

- Targeted at potential U.S. Bank Interns, Virtual Interns, and Comp Sci Interns

- Give my run down on the internship, pros and cons

- Give advice on what to do vs what not to do

- Give advice on what to look for in an internship




Timeline of events:

- Phone interview -> hire for ten week summer internship

- Announced a couple months before the start it would be shortened and virtual due to covid

- A majority of interns kept their job, some did not though

Fast forward to the start of the internship

- Desginated to a team under Technology Services -> Mortgage Roadmap Development

- Was given a virtual machine to do all my work on

- In addition to team work, Campus Relations had a bunch of activites for interns as well, some voluntary some required. Biggest of them being a case competition that had us thrown into groups of all interns from random departments/cities

- In my team, I had two managers and they assigned me to a project with a former intern who recently began full time. 

- We worked on a project called TART, or Transactional Analysis R Tool, without getting too much into the details it was a statistical analysis tool that was to be used by other people in the department

- I was tasked more so on supplying the data to the app as well as modifying it for server deploymnet

- I worked on this, participating in most of the campus relations projects, and had an end of internship presentation as well




What I liked:

- The commitment to keep the internship by U.S. Bank

- The team structure

- The case competition

- Lunch with leaders

- Mentor program

- The work


What I did not like:

- The work environment (virtual machine)

- The onboarding process

- Group meetings (lack of webcams)

- Structure limited the ability to be creative
