What are the goals of this video?

- Targeted at potential U.S. Bank Interns, Virtual Interns, and Comp Sci Interns

- Give my run down on the internship, pros and cons

- Give advice on what to do vs what not to do

- Give advice on what to look for in an internship




Timeline of events:

- Phone interview -> hire for ten week summer internship

- Announced a couple months before the start it would be shortened and virtual due to covid

- A majority of interns kept their job, some did not though

Fast forward to the start of the internship

- Desginated to a team under Technology Services -> Mortgage Roadmap Development

- Was given a virtual machine to do all my work on

- In addition to team work, Campus Relations had a bunch of activites for interns as well, some voluntary some required. Biggest of them being a case competition that had us thrown into groups of all interns from random departments/cities

- In my team, I had two managers and they assigned me to a project with a former intern who recently began full time. 

- We worked on a project called TART, or Transactional Analysis R Tool, without getting too much into the details it was a statistical analysis tool that was to be used by other people in the department

- I was tasked more so on supplying the data to the app as well as modifying it for server deploymnet

- I worked on this, participating in most of the campus relations projects, and had an end of internship presentation as well




What I liked:

- The commitment to keep the internship by U.S. Bank

- The team structure

- The case competition

- Lunch with leaders

- Mentor program

- The work


What I did not like:

- The work environment (virtual machine)

- The onboarding process

- Group meetings (lack of webcams)

- Structure limited the ability to be creative




What worked for me:

- Finding a way to stand out

- Quality communication

- Being open



What you should do to benifit yourself:

- If given the choice, work on areas you see you could improve in
(in the end your development is more important to both parties then short term productivity)

- Don't settle for something you don't want to do

- Don't settle on a "trusted" solution

- Pay close attention to the things we don't learn in school






Brief rundown of the internshp:

So before I start giving my advice let me just give the basic details of what my internship was. So I was hired by U.S. Bank to be a technology services intern back around Feburary right before CoVid blew up. As soon as that happened however, they decided to shift the internship online, and pushed back the start date a couple weeks to prepare for that. 

So U.S. Bank was definitley super rushed to get this set up like I'm sure a lot of other companies were, and I think that definitley contributed to a lot of the negatives I encountered during this internship. However, none of the negatives I encountered come anywhere close to how bad it would've been if the internship was straight up cancelled. U.S. Bank definitley deserves a lot of praise for putting the time and resources into adapting their program for us interns. I'm sure it would've been much easier for them to cancel, but they decided to work to uphold their commitment to their interns, and I think that really speaks volumes to where their priorities are at as a company.

So fast forward to day one of the internship,
