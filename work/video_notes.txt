Video Notes:

Talking points:

- Backround about the internship and myself

- My intern responsibilities

- My experience/thoughts:

	- US Bank cares about their employees

	- They gave me the oppurtunity to do things outside my job role

	- Learn new skills whenever possible
	
	- Finding effective ways to communicate was extremley helpful

	- I stood out even though I didn't do the best work because of my work ethic and innovation

	- Optimizing virtual internships has a long way to go (onboarding, video calls)

	- Adapting to your work environment ASAP is important. Educate yourself on company protocol/terminology

	- Don't be afraid to ask questions (but always try your own solution first)

	-
