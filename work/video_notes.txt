What are the goals of this video?

- Targeted at potential U.S. Bank Interns, Virtual Interns, and Comp Sci Interns

- Give my run down on the internship, pros and cons

- Give advice on what to do vs what not to do

- Give advice on what to look for in an internship




Timeline of events:

- Phone interview -> hire for ten week summer internship

- Announced a couple months before the start it would be shortened and virtual due to covid

- A majority of interns kept their job, some did not though

Fast forward to the start of the internship

- Desginated to a team under Technology Services -> Mortgage Roadmap Development

- Was given a virtual machine to do all my work on

- In addition to team work, Campus Relations had a bunch of activites for interns as well, some voluntary some required. Biggest of them being a case competition that had us thrown into groups of all interns from random departments/cities

- In my team, I had two managers and they assigned me to a project with a former intern who recently began full time. 

- We worked on a project called TART, or Transactional Analysis R Tool, without getting too much into the details it was a statistical analysis tool that was to be used by other people in the department

- I was tasked more so on supplying the data to the app as well as modifying it for server deploymnet

- I worked on this, participating in most of the campus relations projects, and had an end of internship presentation as well




What I liked:

- The commitment to keep the internship by U.S. Bank

- The team structure

- The case competition

- Lunch with leaders

- Mentor program

- The work


What I did not like:

- The work environment (virtual machine)

- The onboarding process

- Group meetings (lack of webcams)

- Structure limited the ability to be creative




What worked for me:

- Finding a way to stand out

- Quality communication

- Being open



What you should do to benifit yourself:

- If given the choice, work on areas you see you could improve in
(in the end your development is more important to both parties then short term productivity)

- Don't settle for something you don't want to do

- Don't settle on a "trusted" solution

- Pay close attention to the things we don't learn in school
